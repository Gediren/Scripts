# PowerShell_Scripts
This collection of PowerShell scripts serves as a backup for myself, as well as a way to keep track of changes made over time. most of them should work in most environments, but I make no promises. Some were created by me, others were found online and modified to fit my needs. I will be adding to and updating these files over time, however once again I make no promises of functionality in your environment.<br>

**PLEASE NOTE**
Malware scripts are for education and reference ONLY. DO NOT run against a real person. I write them to learn how they work and exercise my mind thinking about new things, not for you to use against that one guy who picked on you last week.

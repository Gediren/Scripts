# Scripts
This is a collection of Powershell scripts I've found useful over the years. Most were written by me, some I found online and modified for my specific environment. These are public versions, so nothing is "hard coded" or preset, and comments will denote if something needs to be changed before use. If you have any suggestions or questions please feel free to reach out to me and I will do my best to answer them.

## Descriptions
- Active Directory: Anythig specifically pertaining to AD or user accounts.
- Automation: Small tasks that would be annoying to remember or repetitive run manually.
- Fixes: Automates fixing small issues, like restarting the print spooler or relaunching Windows Explorer.
- Maintenance: Work in Progress...
- Misc: Anything that doesn't fir neatly into one of these categories. See: personal projects.
- Reports: Gather and output information about the user or system.

## Disclaimer
Please be aware that while I make an effort to create these scripts in a way where they can be used in any environment, some may require modification to work properly in your use case. That being said, if you discover something that straight up does not function please open an Issue here on GitHub and I will be in touch.

# PowerShell_Scripts
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts I find useful.
Some of them I created from scratch, some of them I found online and modified to fit my needs.
If some of them work for you, feel free to use a modify them.

**bulk_rename** - renames a large number of items. Needs further testing and expansion.<br>
**installed_software** - Writes a list of all installed software and it's properties to the current user's desktop.<br>
**maintenance** - Runs a system cleanup, optimizes HDDs and SSDs and writes a log file to the desktop, then shuts off the computer. PLEASE NOTE Admin rights are needed. Simply run the included .bat file and it will run the script for you.<br>
**system_report** - Gives a brief rundown of the PC, including COU and Memory specifications, OS info, and more.<br>

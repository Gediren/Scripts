# Scripts
This collection of PowerShell scripts serves as a backup for myself, as well as a way to keep track of changes made over time. I try to write them in a way that anyone can use them, but I make no guarantees. Some were created by me, others were found online and modified to fit my needs.<br>

They are primarily PowerShell, will a little bit of Batch thrown in there. I might add some macOS scripts eventually too.
